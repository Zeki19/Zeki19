- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zeki19 (Ezequiel). I'm a 25yo guy from Argentina, who is studying to become a Videogame Designer. I'm studying at UADE in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
- I love playing games. World of Warcraft, League of Legends, TeamFight Tactics, Baldur's Gate 3... well I can't list them all.
- I also love hanging out with my friends, and doing Games Night, where we play different type of board games like: UNO (with new rules), Catan, Secret Dictator, Podri, Sushi Go!, among other things.
